# Netlify Deployment Test

## Files Check ✅

-   [x] `dist/index.html` exists
-   [x] `dist/dda.js` exists
-   [x] `dist/dda.wasm` exists
-   [x] All files are committed to git

## Configuration Check ✅

-   [x] `publish = "dist"` in netlify.toml
-   [x] Simple build command (no complex dependencies)
-   [x] Removed problematic redirect rules
-   [x] Proper MIME types for WASM files

## Expected Netlify Build Output

```
build.command from netlify.toml
$ echo 'Using pre-built files'
Using pre-built files

Publishing directory: dist
✅ Site deployed successfully
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

If site is still not working:

1. **Check Netlify Deploy Logs**

    - Look for "Publishing directory: dist"
    - Ensure no 404 errors on files

2. **Verify File Structure**

    ```
    dist/
    ├── index.html
    ├── dda.js
    └── dda.wasm
    ```

3. **Test Locally**

    ```bash
    cd dist
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    # Visit http://localhost:8080
    ```

4. **Check Netlify Site Settings**
    - Build command: `echo 'Using pre-built files'`
    - Publish directory: `dist`
    - No environment variables needed

## Next Deploy

The site should work after the latest push (commit: 66caef4)
